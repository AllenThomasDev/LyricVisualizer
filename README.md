# LyricVisualizer
This is essentially a clone of [SongSim](https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/#/) which is an online tool created by [Colin Morris](https://github.com/colinmorris)

This was built entirely in Python and is hosted [here](lyricviz.herokuapp.com)

While SongSim has a lot of features, there are some that it lacks - 
1. Users cannot 'search' for songs, they have to manually copy and paste a lyrics in case the song they want to visualize is not in the examples
1. The heatmap is static, users cannot zoom or filter
